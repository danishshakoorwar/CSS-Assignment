Absolute and relative positioning are two CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) properties used to control the placement of elements
 within a web page. Here's an explanation of the differences between absolute and relative positioning:

Relative Positioning:

Definition: When an element is set to be relatively positioned, it is positioned relative to its normal position in the 
document flow.
Reference Point: The element is moved from its default position, but the space it would have occupied is still reserved,
affecting the layout of surrounding elements.
Usage: It's often used when you want to make minor adjustments to the position of an element without disrupting the normal
 flow of the document.

Absolute Positioning:

Definition: When an element is set to be absolutely positioned, it is removed from the normal document flow and positioned 
relative to its closest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position other than static), or to the initial containing 
block if there is no positioned ancestor.
Reference Point: The element is taken out of the normal document flow, and its position is determined based on its closest
 positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.
Usage: It's often used when you want to place an element at a specific location on the page, regardless of its normal position
 in the document flow.

The var() function in CSS serves the purpose of referencing and using the values of custom properties, also known as CSS variables. 
CSS variables allow you to define reusable values in your stylesheets and then reference those values wherever you need them.

Here's a breakdown of the purposes and benefits of using the var() function:

Reusability: You can define a value once and reuse it throughout your stylesheet. This makes it easier to maintain a consistent 
design across your website or application.

Consistency: By using variables, you ensure that related elements share the same values. This consistency helps in maintaining 
a cohesive and unified design.

Ease of Maintenance: If you need to update a color, font size, or any other property, you can do so by modifying the variable 
value. This change will automatically propagate to all the places where the variable is used, reducing the risk of errors and
 making maintenance more efficient.

Dynamic Theming: Variables can be changed dynamically using JavaScript. This enables dynamic theming, where you can switch
 between different color schemes or themes without having to modify individual style rules
